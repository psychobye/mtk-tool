# 🛠 MTK TOOL

**MTK TOOL** is a reversed and modified version of the classic **Img Tool Android**, upgraded to support direct decryption of `.mtk` files on open.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📂 browse & manage `.mtk` game archives  
- 🔓 automatic decryption on file open  
- ❌ no re-encryption — encryption happens on client exit  
  → handled in the [LIT CLIENT](https://github.com/psychobye/lit-client/) repo

## 📌 Notes

This tool is meant for quick editing and inspection of `.mtk` archives used in **LIT ENERGY MOBILE**.  
It does **not** support creating or re-encrypting `.mtk` files — encryption is built into the game client itself.
